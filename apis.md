description: Measure operates turnkey drone solutions to deliver cost-effective actionable
  data to enterprise customers. Measure was founded specifically to help customers
  avoid the capital expense and operating risks of establishing their own drone programs
  and to purchase drone support in a way which better fits their operations and cost
  profiles. In a market largely comprised of manufacturers, Measure is the model for
  how drone services will develop and grow in the future.
